# -Glucose-Level-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
This project uses machine learning techniques to predict glucose levels from health-related data using the Framingham Heart Study dataset.

📂 Project Structure
- framingham.csv – Dataset used for model training
- Glucose_Prediction_Final_Notebook.ipynb – Clean and complete Jupyter Notebook with all steps
- README.md – Project overview

💡 Objective
To develop a machine learning model that can help predict glucose levels based on a person’s medical and lifestyle features, supporting early diagnosis and health monitoring.

🧠 What’s Inside
This notebook includes:
- Data exploration & cleaning
- Feature selection and engineering
- Visualization of glucose distribution
- Model training using:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Tree
  - Random Forest
- Model evaluation using classification metrics
- Feature importance plot

📊 Key Libraries Used
- pandas, numpy
- matplotlib, seaborn
- scikit-learn

📈 Result
Among all the models tested, *Random Forest* gave the best performance. Important features affecting glucose levels include:
- BMI
- Age
- Blood Pressure

🔚 Conclusion
This project shows how machine learning can be used for healthcare predictions and decision support systems. It can be extended with:
- Larger and more diverse datasets
- Deep learning models
